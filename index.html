    It's intended to be played between two people.<br>
    The first player is always the Seahorse and the second player is Holberton.<br>
    Seahorse always goes first where it marks a space and then, Holberton.<br>
    The winner needs to mark three spaces horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br>
    If it's a draw, the players would need to decide either to restart or rematch.<br>
